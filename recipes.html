    <h1 class= "title"> Maqlooba</h1>
    <div class= "navbar1">
     <p class= "T1">The word Maqlooba (or Maqloobeh) is Arabic for ‘upside down’.<br> That does not mean the meal is eaten standing on your head, but rather the dish is prepared in a pot with the chicken at the bottom and the rice on top,<br> then the whole thing is turned over on a plate to make for a beautiful and dramatic cake-like presentation.<br> This is one of those dishes that would be the centerpiece for any occasion and will have people wowing at how pretty it looks.<br> It tastes really amazing too!

    <h1 class= "title"> Mansaf</h1>
    <div class="navbar1">
     <p  class= "T1"> The history of this dish is one that goes back a long way and was a meal eaten by bedouin tribes.<br> Originally it was a dish made with either camel or lamb meat,<br> served with a very thin flat bread and a meat broth and clarified butter.
     It has evolved to include rice, and a yogurt sauce, flavoured and made with jameed,<br> a dehydrated salty yogurt, that is reconstituted with water.

    <h1 class= "title"> Warak Enab</h1>
    <div class="navbar1">
     <p  class= "T1"> Warak Enab is basically the Arab version of Greek dolmas. “Warak” means paper, and “Enab” means grapes.<br> While picking the leaves is simple enough, many people are intimidated about making their first pot of warak enab.<br> This is the kind of delicacy that can take more than an hour to prepare, and less than 10 minutes to eat because the tender leaves surrounding fragrant rice and lamb are addictive and irresistible.<br> However, this recipe is quite simple and worth the effort. Enlisting the help of family members to roll up the grape leaves not only cuts preparation time, it also makes the dish more special for everyone involved.

    <h1 class= "title"> Taboulah</h1>
    <div class= "navbar1">
      <p  class= "T1"> It can also be written tabouleh or tabouli, from Arabic tabūlah (تبولة) and it could definitely be considered the national dish,<br> or at least one of the national dishes of Lebanon.
        Tabbouleh is a cold salad prepared with parsley, onion, tomato and bulgur, that is originally from Lebanon but also from Syria.</p>
